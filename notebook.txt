Initial ideas:
- In each server program, store unordered mapping from username to all messages sent to that username
    - In order!
- Update all server programs EVERY time a new message comes in from ANY user
- All clients connect to a main server
- Two backup servers indepedently connect to the main server almost as if they were clients
- Main client-server interactions still function as before but we maintain log of all previous messages
- Whenever a client sends a message through the server to another, the server sends copies to both backup servers
- Backup servers have a hierarchy: server 2, server 3
- If the main server dies, all users are logged out and they reconnect to server 2
- Server 3 connects to server 2 to continue being its backup
- Optional: if server 1 comes back up, it should reconnect to server 2 (or server 3 if it has become main) to now 
  join the circulation as its backup?
